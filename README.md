The password generator consists of 4 types of values:
Numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.

Each one set in an individual array. When the "generate button" is clicked, it runs a confirm asking if the user wants to generate a password.

Then, it prompts an input so the user can determine the password's length, and asks which types of characters will you include on the password.

Finally it runs the function to generate a random password with the selected criteria, displayed on the box.
